# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying breast cancer using various algorithms. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine whether breast cancer is benign or malignant based on features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
